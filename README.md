## Bella Ot√©r - Raven Body Profile

### Overview

I created it a mobile-first, single-page experience built to simulate the first step of the **Raven Body Profile** ‚Äî Bella Ot√©r's loungewear discovery flow.

The goal of this build was to create a **visually intuitive and soothing** interface that reflects Bella Ot√©r‚Äôs brand philosophy.

### Design Philosophy

#### Selection of Colors

- I used a soft neutral base background (`#ededed`) to reflect a sense of calm and minimalism ‚Äî a canvas that doesn‚Äôt distract, but lets emotions breathe.

- For typography and accents, I opted for muted light brown tones to stay grounded in earthy warmth, aligning with Bella Ot√©r‚Äôs emotional tone: **gentle, grounded, self-connected**. These tones evoke _natural materials_ like sand, silk, and clay.

#### Main background

- I used a **gradient background image**, with a **noisy grainy overlay effect** incorporated with some tints of warm ivory and subtle light pink (muted shades) over the gradient to emphasize the gentleness, soft and calming UI

### Selection Options

- Instead of using default buttons or radio inputs, I wanted to **elevate the emotional storytelling** by representing each feeling ‚Äî _Grounding, Softness, Energy, Freedom_ ‚Äî with a **visual moodboard-style block**.

- Each block uses a AI-generated image (some are stock images) to **visualize the emotion depicted**, helping the user connect emotionally rather than cognitively.

- This helps shift the quiz from ‚Äúselecting an option‚Äù to ‚Äúrecognizing a feeling.‚Äù

### Product Result Reveal Logic

- Upon selecting an option, the question fades away and a _matching archetype_ result is revealed ‚Äî complete with a name, product, description, and fabric type.

- Here I used soft transitions and timed fades to preserve emotional flow.

### Welcome back global Blimp

I have used a fixed height, full width welcome blimp, which I initially created as a global information notifier. This is placed on the top of the application where user can notice it without missing out.

### Time Spent

I spent approximately **10 hours** on this task.

- Majority of the time (~7 hours) was dedicated to **finding or generating the right images** that visually reflect the emotional tones of each option. I explored stock sites and AI generation tools to get the best fit.

- The remaining **3 hours** were spent **designing and coding** the mobile-first page, keeping in mind to make it responsive and minimal layout that aligns with the brand tone.

---

### What I‚Äôd Improve with More Time

- **Dark Mode Transitions**: I thought of a **morphing gradient animation** that would transition images smoothly between light and dark modes, creating a seamless emotional shift. Due to time/image generation constraints, this wasn‚Äôt implemented.

- **Micro-interactions**: I would enhance the page with **button feedback**, subtle **interaction animations**, and possibly **hover/tap ripple effects** to make the experience feel more alive and tactile.
